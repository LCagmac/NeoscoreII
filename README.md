# NeoscoreII


Run the Projectexample.py file in the terminal with python. Press a key to trigger the shape animations and the movement of the Kaleidoscope handpiece. 

Musical notes are in the background of the demo. As the shapes move they sometimes trade places with each other. With some colored shapes being in front and other shapes in the background. With the Kaleidoscope handpiece I would like to have it respond to key codes so it contracts and expands revealing different amounts of the score.
